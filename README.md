Hi.

If you're here, you must be bored. But your inquisitiveness shall be rewarded with a joke.

I have Altzheimers and cancer, but at least i don't have Altzheimers.

There will also be code visible here at some point. I'm currently working on my solutions for CodinGame exercises, but the project is still in progress and not in a functional state. Once that changes, I'll make it public for the 2 people that may/may not end up here by mistake.
